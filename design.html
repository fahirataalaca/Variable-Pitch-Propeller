            <h2>Design & Development Version Overview</h2>
            <p>The design and development process of our variable pitch propeller focuses on adapting tuburcles on propeller blades to optimize the performance of propellers. We started by researching the effects of tubercles on the blades and their potential impact on propellers. In addition we wanted to investigate the effect of tuburcles on variable pitch propellers. In order to build a varibale pitch propeller, we used bevel gears instead of a governor. We used a total of 4 bevel gears. The bevel gears have a 1 to 4 ratio. Two of the larger bevel gears are connected to the propeller blades, one of them is connected to our stepper motor and the other is free axle and serves a purose of stabilzing the larger bevel gears. The 1 to 4 ratio ensures that the blades can perform accurate movements even tough if the motor can't make such movemnts and they reduce the torque load on the motor. Additionally, we used 608ZZ bearings for the bevel gears to perfectly stabilize them. The shafts all meet in an inner housing and this also contributes to the stabilization of the gears. The outer housing keeps all the components together and has two small holes to perofrm operations while keeping the outehr housing closed. The propeller casing grips two nuts which are connected to the main shaft and this shaft spins the propeller.</p>

            <h2>Design Changes After First Test</h2>
            <p>In our first test, the casing of the propeller broke due to the weak structure of our propeller casing. We have made the propeller casing thicker and with no holes for cooling the motor; the casing now has the shape of a slighlty ouwars sloped cylinder. Also we designed the inside of the propeller casing as an octagon in order to make sitcking or screwing parts into the propeller casing easier.  </p>

            <h2>Design Changes After Second Test</h2>
            <p>After our second test, our propeller only slightly cracked. This was mainly due to the shaft that was holding the propellering being loose. Even though the nuts on the shaft held the propeller firmly before the test, the pressure loaded on them caused the housing of the nuts too loosen and get deformed. We have concluded that this was caused by the PLA material being not strong enough. However, we couldn't switch to a more durable material like metal. After careful consideration, we realized that the surface area of the metric 10 nuts were too small and they were loading too much pressure on the housing so we decided to increase the surface area of our nuts and we swithced to metric 20 nuts.  </p>
